# [Description](#contents)

SimplePoseNet is a convolution-based neural network for the task of human pose estimation and tracking. It provides baseline methods that are surprisingly simple and effective, thus helpful for inspiring and evaluating new ideas for the field. State-of-the-art results are achieved on challenging benchmarks. More detail about this model can be found in:

 B. Xiao, H. Wu, and Y. Wei, “Simple baselines for human pose estimation and tracking,” in Proc. Eur. Conf. Comput. Vis., 2018, pp. 472–487.

This repository contains a Mindspore implementation of SimplePoseNet based upon Microsoft's original Pytorch implementation (<https://github.com/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch>). The training and validating scripts are also included, and the evaluation results are shown in the [Performance](#performance) section.

# [Model Architecture](#contents)

The overall network architecture of SimplePoseNet is shown below:

# [Dataset](#contents)

Note that you can run the scripts based on the dataset mentioned in original paper or widely used in relevant domain/network architecture. In the following sections, we will introduce how to run the scripts using the related dataset below.

Dataset used: COCO2017

- Dataset size:
    - Train: 19G, 118,287 images
    - Test: 788MB, 5,000 images
- Data format: JPG images
    - Note: Data will be processed in `src/dataset.py`
- Person detection result for validation: Detection result provided by author in the [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch)

# [Features](#contents)

## [Mixed Precision](#contents)

The [mixed precision](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorial/training/en/master/advanced_use/enable_mixed_precision.html) training method accelerates the deep learning neural network training process by using both the single-precision and half-precision data formats, and maintains the network precision achieved by the single-precision training at the same time. Mixed precision training can accelerate the computation process, reduce memory usage, and enable a larger model or batch size to be trained on specific hardware. For FP16 operators, if the input data type is FP32, the backend of MindSpore will automatically handle it with reduced precision. Users could check the reduced-precision operators by enabling INFO log and then searching ‘reduce precision’.

# [Quick Start](#contents)

## [Dataset Preparation](#contents)

SimplePoseNet use COCO2017 dataset to train and validate in this repository. Download the dataset from [official website](https://cocodataset.org/). You can place the dataset anywhere and tell the scripts where it is by modifying the `DATASET.ROOT` setting in configuration file `src/config.py`. For more information about the configuration file, please refer to [Script Parameters](#script-parameters).

You also need the person detection result of COCO val2017 to reproduce the multi-person pose estimation results, as mentioned in [Dataset](#dataset). Please checkout the author's repository, download and extract them under `<ROOT>/experiments/`, and make them look like this:

```text
└─ <ROOT>
 └─ experiments
   └─ COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json
```

## [Model Checkpoints](#contents)

Before you start your training process, you need to obtain mindspore imagenet pretrained models. The model weight file can be obtained by running the Resnet training script in [official model zoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/official/cv/resnet). We also provide a pretrained model that can be used to train SimplePoseNet directly in [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r3Hs0QNys0HyNtsQhSvx6IKdyRkC-3Hh/view?usp=sharing). The model file should be placed under `<ROOT>/models/` like this:

```text
└─ <ROOT>
 └─ models
  └─resnet50.ckpt
```

## [Running](#contents)

To train the model, run the shell script `scripts/train_standalone.sh` with the format below:

```shell
sh scripts/train_standalone.sh [device_id] [ckpt_path_to_save]
```

To validate the model, change the settings in `src/config.py` to the path of the model you want to validate. For example:

```python
config.TEST.MODEL_FILE='results/xxxx.ckpt'
```

Then, run the shell script `scripts/eval.sh` with the format below:

```shell
sh scripts/eval.sh [device_id]
```

## [Training Process](#contents)

### [Training](#contents)

#### Running on Ascend

Run `scripts/train_standalone.sh` to train the model standalone. The usage of the script is:

```shell
sh scripts/train_standalone.sh [device_id] [ckpt_path_to_save]
```

For example, you can run the shell command below to launch the training procedure.

```shell
sh scripts/train_standalone.sh 0 results/standalone/
```

The script will run training in the background, you can view the results through the file `train_log[X].txt` as follows:

```text
loading parse...
batch size :128
loading dataset from /data/coco2017/train2017
loaded 149813 records from coco dataset.
loading pretrained model ./models/resnet50.ckpt
start training, epoch size = 140
epoch: 1 step: 1170, loss is 0.000699
Epoch time: 492271.194, per step time: 420.745
epoch: 2 step: 1170, loss is 0.000586
Epoch time: 456265.617, per step time: 389.971
...
```

The model checkpoint will be saved into `[ckpt_path_to_save]`.

### [Distributed Training](#contents)

#### Running on Ascend

Run `scripts/train_distributed.sh` to train the model distributed. The usage of the script is:

```shell
sh scripts/train_distributed.sh [rank_table] [ckpt_path_to_save] [device_number]
```

For example, you can run the shell command below to launch the distributed training procedure.

```shell
sh scripts/train_distributed.sh /home/rank_table.json results/distributed/ 4
```

The above shell script will run distribute training in the background. You can view the results through the file `train_parallel[X]/log.txt` as follows:

```text
loading parse...
batch size :64
loading dataset from /data/coco2017/train2017
loaded 149813 records from coco dataset.
loading pretrained model ./models/resnet50.ckpt
start training, epoch size = 140
epoch: 1 step: 585, loss is 0.0007944
Epoch time: 236219.684, per step time: 403.794
epoch: 2 step: 585, loss is 0.000617
Epoch time: 164792.001, per step time: 281.696
...
```

The model checkpoint will be saved into `[ckpt_path_to_save]`.

## [Evaluation Process](#contents)

### Running on Ascend

Change the settings in `src/config.py` to the path of the model you want to validate. For example:

```python
config.TEST.MODEL_FILE='results/xxxx.ckpt'
```

Then, run `scripts/eval.sh` to evaluate the model with one Ascend processor. The usage of the script is:

```shell
sh scripts/eval.sh [device_id]
```

For example, you can run the shell command below to launch the validation procedure.

```shell
sh scripts/eval.sh 0
```

The above shell command will run validation procedure in the background. You can view the results through the file `eval_log[X].txt`. The result will be achieved as follows:

```text
use flip test: True
loading model ckpt from results/distributed/sim-140_1170.ckpt
loading dataset from /data/coco2017/val2017
loading bbox file from experiments/COCO_val2017_detections_AP_H_56_person.json
Total boxes: 104125
1024 samples validated in 18.133189916610718 seconds
2048 samples validated in 4.724390745162964 seconds
